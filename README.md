I upload this file for you to get teh knowledge about what is SQA work and how the testing is perform on apps 
so  here are the few description of the test cases how they are made and about the bug report.
Test Cases
1. Purpose:
Test cases are designed to verify that a particular feature or functionality of an application behaves as expected. They help ensure that all aspects of the feature are tested and that any potential issues are identified before the software is released.

2. Components of a Test Case:

Test Case ID: A unique identifier for the test case.
Test Case Title: A brief description of the functionality being tested.
Preconditions: Conditions that must be met before executing the test case.
Test Steps: Detailed steps to perform the test.
Expected Result: The anticipated outcome if the feature behaves correctly.
Actual Result: The actual outcome observed during testing (filled out after execution).
Status: Pass or Fail, based on whether the actual result matches the expected result.
Comments: Any additional notes or observations.
3. Steps to Create a Test Case:

Identify the Requirement: Understand the feature or functionality that needs to be tested.
Define Test Objectives: Clearly outline what the test case is intended to verify.
Create Test Steps: Write out the precise steps to execute the test.
Specify Expected Results: Describe what the expected outcome of each step should be.
Review and Refine: Ensure the test case is comprehensive, clear, and free of ambiguities.
Document Test Case: Enter the test case details into a test management tool or document.
4. Execution and Documentation:

Execute the test case according to the defined steps.
Document the actual results and compare them with the expected results.
Update the status based on whether the test passed or failed.
Bug Reports
1. Purpose:
Bug reports are used to document issues or defects found during testing. They provide a detailed description of the problem, allowing developers to understand and fix the issue.

2. Components of a Bug Report:

Bug ID: A unique identifier for the bug.
Summary: A brief description of the issue.
Description: A detailed explanation of the problem.
Steps to Reproduce: Exact steps to replicate the issue.
Expected Result: What should have happened if the bug did not exist.
Actual Result: What actually happened.
Severity/Priority: The impact of the bug on the application and its urgency.
Environment: Details about the testing environment (e.g., OS, browser, device).
Attachments: Screenshots, logs, or other relevant files.
Status: Current status of the bug (e.g., Open, In Progress, Closed).

3. Steps to Create a Bug Report:

Identify the Issue: Observe and verify the problem while executing test cases.
Reproduce the Bug: Ensure that the issue can be consistently replicated.
Document the Bug: Record all the details in the bug report template.
Submit the Report: Share the bug report with the development team or relevant stakeholders.
Track and Verify: Monitor the bug's progress and verify the fix once it's addressed.

4. Post-Reporting:

Follow Up: Communicate with developers to understand the fix and provide additional information if needed.
Retest: Once a fix is implemented, retest the functionality to ensure the issue is resolved.
